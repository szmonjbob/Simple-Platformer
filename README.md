Hello there!
If you are here to look over and review my code for the game, allow me to direct you!

The Important stuff is all contained in oPlayer's create event.
this is where all the freeState code is, which allows for standard movement, and variable jump height
this is also where the dashState code is.

oCamera contains all the code related to camera movement.
